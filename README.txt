How to run: On windows, double click "windows.exe". Windows defender will
probably warn you that this is an unknown program. You'll have to run it
anyways, because I am not spending money to get a certificate from Microsoft.

On linux, run the file "linux".

You can also run these files through the command line. If you don't provide any
arguments, it enters an interactive mode where you can repeatedly input things
to plot. If you do provide arguments, the arguments are plotted and then the
program quits. You can also pipe the program's output to a file.


How to use: Input something like "8d6", "4d6*(3d6+2)", etc, and an ASCII art
plot will show up. The program detects the size of your terminal and sizes the
plot to fill the terminal window.
